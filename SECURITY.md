# Security Policy

## Overview

OpenAuditLabs/Site takes security seriously. This document outlines our security policy and procedures for reporting security vulnerabilities in our Next.js landing page application.

## Supported Versions

We actively support and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

Security updates will be applied to the latest production version. We recommend always using the most recent release.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in OpenAuditLabs/Site, we appreciate your responsible disclosure. Please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please report security issues by:

1. **Email**: Send a detailed report to `security@openauditslabs.org`
2. **Subject Line**: Use "[SECURITY] Brief description of the issue"

### What to Include

Please provide as much detail as possible to help us understand and reproduce the issue:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Type of Issue**: (e.g., XSS, CSRF, injection, etc.)
- **Location**: File paths, URLs, or specific areas affected
- **Reproduction Steps**: Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a minimal working example
- **Impact Assessment**: Potential impact and exploitability
- **Environment**: Browser, Node.js version, operating system
- **Suggested Fix**: If known, proposed solution or mitigation

### Response Timeline

We are committed to the following response standards:

- **Initial Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of report receipt
- **Issue Validation**: Within 5 business days
- **Status Updates**: Weekly updates during resolution
- **Resolution**: Timeline varies based on complexity and severity

## Disclosure Policy

We follow responsible disclosure principles:

1. **Verification**: We will validate and investigate all reports
2. **Communication**: We will keep you informed of progress throughout the process
3. **Fix Development**: We will develop and test patches for confirmed vulnerabilities
4. **Coordinated Release**: We will coordinate with you on the disclosure timeline
5. **Public Disclosure**: After fixes are deployed, we may publish a security advisory
6. **Recognition**: With your permission, we will acknowledge your contribution

## Security Scope

### In Scope

The following are considered within scope for security reports:

- **Authentication/Authorization Issues**: Access control vulnerabilities
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Reflected, stored, or DOM-based XSS
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**: CSRF vulnerabilities
- **Content Security Policy (CSP) Bypass**: CSP configuration issues
- **Server-Side Vulnerabilities**: Next.js server-side security issues
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Security issues in npm packages
- **Information Disclosure**: Unintended data exposure
- **Security Header Issues**: Missing or misconfigured security headers

### Out of Scope

The following are generally **not** considered security vulnerabilities:

- **Social Engineering**: Attacks targeting users rather than the application
- **Physical Attacks**: Physical access to infrastructure
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Resource exhaustion attacks
- **Spam or Abuse**: Content-based issues not related to security
- **Issues Requiring Physical Access**: Local access vulnerabilities
- **Third-Party Services**: Security issues in external services we use
- **Browser-Specific Issues**: Problems only affecting outdated browsers
- **Self-XSS**: XSS that requires user interaction to exploit themselves

## Security Best Practices

As a Next.js application, we implement several security measures:

### Frontend Security

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Restrictive CSP headers to prevent XSS
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All communications encrypted with TLS
- **Secure Headers**: Implementation of security-focused HTTP headers
- **Input Sanitization**: Proper handling and validation of user inputs
- **React Security**: Following React security best practices

### Development Security

- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates and security scanning
- **Code Review**: All changes reviewed before deployment
- **Static Analysis**: Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- **Environment Variables**: Secure handling of configuration and secrets

### Infrastructure Security

- **Deployment Security**: Secure deployment processes and configurations
- **Access Control**: Limited access to production systems
- **Monitoring**: Security monitoring and incident detection
- **Backup Security**: Secure backup and recovery procedures

## Security Resources

### For Developers

- **Secure Coding Guidelines**: Follow Next.js security best practices
- **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update dependencies using `pnpm audit`
- **Security Testing**: Run security tests before submitting contributions
- **Environment Security**: Never commit secrets or sensitive data

### For Users

- **Browser Security**: Use updated browsers with security features enabled
- **Network Security**: Use secure networks when accessing the site
- **Privacy Settings**: Review and configure browser privacy settings
- **Report Issues**: Report any suspicious activity or security concerns

## Legal

### Safe Harbor

- Follow our disclosure policy
- Act in good faith
- Do not access or modify data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the vulnerability
- Do not disrupt our services or systems
- Do not violate any applicable laws or regulations

### Privacy

- We will keep your vulnerability report confidential
- Personal information will not be shared without your explicit consent
- We may use anonymized information for security improvements

## Compliance and Standards

Our security practices align with:

- **OWASP Top 10**: Protection against common web application vulnerabilities
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Industry-standard security practices
- **Secure Development Lifecycle**: Security considerations throughout development
- **Open Source Security**: Following open source security best practices

## Updates to This Policy

This security policy may be updated periodically to reflect:

- Changes in our security practices
