              Our analysis engine scans smart contract code end-to-end, flagging
              risky patterns like reentrancy, improper access control, unchecked
              external calls, and arithmetic mistakes. Findings are grouped by
              severity and accompanied by concise explanations, so engineers can
              quickly understand the root cause and impact without digging
              through stack traces.

              Results include prioritized remediation steps, example fixes, and
              gas-optimization suggestions to reduce costs while preserving
              security. Designed for developer workflows, the output is
              machine-readable for CI integration and human-friendly for code
              review â€” enabling continuous auditing, faster triage, and fewer
              false positives as the model learns from project-specific context.
